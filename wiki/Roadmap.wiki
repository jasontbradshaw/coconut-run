=Milestone 1 - 2009.06.14=

==<font color="green">Accomplished!</font>==

A rudimentary _playable_ version with crappy graphics and no interface. Basically, we should be able to:

 * run `$ python coconut_run.py`
 * see menu screen; hit button to play
 * dodge coconuts
  * input --> change state --> output loop
  * collision detection
 * lose lives
 * exit game when lives < 0

=Milestone 2 - 2009.08.02=

==<font color="orange">Deadline Approaching.</font>==

Milestone 2 build should look very close to the final game in terms of game play. Features such as menus and level designer is deferred to a later milestone. 

 * generate goal value and earn points when values are met
 * nice outputs of operands, operators, and formulas at bottom of screen
 * catch coconuts, throw away coconuts, and block coconuts from being caught
 * "accept" a formula.

=Milestone 3=
 * multiple levels to choose from
 * modifiable game settings in main menu
 * load level settings from a file

=Release Candidate 1=
 * ZERO [http://code.google.com/p/coconut-run/issues/list?can=2&q=label:Defect defects]!
