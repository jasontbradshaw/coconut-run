=Milestone 1 - 2009.06.14=

==<font color="green">Accomplished!</font>==

A rudimentary _playable_ version with crappy graphics and no interface. Basically, we should be able to:

 * run `$ python coconut_run.py`
 * see menu screen; hit button to play
 * dodge coconuts
  * input --> change state --> output loop
  * collision detection
 * lose lives
 * exit game when lives < 0

=Milestone 2=

Add fundamental features to the game play.

 * what is the goal of the game?
  * just dodging coconuts is boring
  * why is the player dodging coconuts? give the player a *motivation*
   * need a back story
  * how do you win?
 * scoring system - points per second
 * special drop items - life, umbrella, etc
  * a good way to motivate players to move away from the center of the screen
 * true FPS management
  * useful for other features such as acceleration

=Milestone 3=
 * multiple levels to choose from
 * modifiable game settings in main menu
