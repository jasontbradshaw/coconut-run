Here we will keep a record of features we want/need, and ideas of how to implement them (or at least how to _learn_ how we could implement them).
<br>
Add them as you see fit, and we'll discuss their merits.  Entries should follow the format:
<br>

*title*

_description_

*True FPS Management*
<br>
_Instead of locking the frame-rate down to some arbitrary constant (currently 60 FPS), we should have it dynamically adapt based on how fast the machine is currently rendering it._
<br>
A sprite's movement speed should adapt based on the current frame-rate, and should appear to move at the same real-world speed regardless of whether the machine is rendering the level at 6 or 600 FPS.

*Coconut collision animation effect*
<br>
_Sound, special effects (dirt rise from ground after ground collision), text, shadows increase in size as coconuts fall._
<br>
Quite trivial.
