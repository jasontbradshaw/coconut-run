Here we will keep a record of features we want/need, and ideas of how to implement them (or at least how to _learn_ how we could implement them).

Add them as you see fit, and we'll discuss their merits.

===True FPS Management===
Instead of locking the frame-rate down to some arbitrary constant (currently 60 FPS), we should have it dynamically adapt based on how fast the machine is currently rendering it.

*Implementation:* A sprite's movement speed should adapt based on the current frame-rate, and should appear to move at the same real-world speed regardless of whether the machine is rendering the level at 6 or 600 FPS.  How: http://www.gamedev.net/reference/articles/article1382.asp

===Coconut collision animation effect===
Sound, special effects (dirt rise from ground after ground collision), text, shadows increase in size as coconuts fall.
